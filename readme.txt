Assume the entire power system meet the N-1 security and all power physics of flow limits
Step 1: Run ARR_Phase0.py to generate the initial plan on the entire network.
Step 2: Run ARR_Phase2.py to perform the ARR procedure.
Step 3: Run ARR_Phase2_Continued.py to continue the ARR procedure.

If the entire power system is not feasible, move ARR_Phase1.py to this super-folder.
